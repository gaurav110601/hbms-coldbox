# Hotel Booking Management System Using ColdBox and MySQL
The **Hotel Booking Management System** is a web application designed to simplify and streamline hotel room reservations and management processes. This application overcomes the limitations of traditional manual systems, offering efficiency, data integrity, and ease of use. It is built using **ColdBox**, a powerful and modular MVC framework for ColdFusion (CFML), and leverages a MySQL database for data storage.

## üåê Project Overview
This system includes two major modules: **Admin** and **User**. It allows hotel staff to manage room categories, bookings, customer inquiries, and content pages. Users can register, view room listings, make bookings, and manage their own profiles.

In the Hotel Booking Management System we use the ColdBox MVC Framework and a MySQL Database. This project keeps records of bookings, clients, and hotel services. The Hotel Booking Management System has two modules: admin and user.

## Admin Module

1. **Home:** In this section, the admin can briefly view the total new bookings, approved bookings, cancelled bookings, total registered users, total read enquiries, and total unread enquiries.
2. **Room Category:** In this section, the admin can manage the room categories (add/delete).
3. **New Room:** In this section, the admin can manage rooms (add/update).
